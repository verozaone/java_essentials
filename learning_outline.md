# Java Study Guide: Beginner to Advanced

---

## Beginner Level

### 1. Introduction to Java and Setting Up Environment
- **Topics**: Installing Java Development Kit (JDK), setting up an IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition), understanding Java's syntax and structure.
- **Exercise**: Write a "Hello World" program, compile, and run it.

### 2. Basic Syntax and Variables
- **Topics**: Data types (`int`, `double`, `String`, `boolean`), variables, operators, and comments.
- **Exercise**: Write a program to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle with hardcoded values for length and width.

### 3. Control Structures
- **Topics**: Conditionals (`if`, `else`, `switch`), loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`).
- **Exercise**: Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz" and multiples of 5 with "Buzz".

### 4. Functions and Methods
- **Topics**: Defining methods, method parameters, return values, method overloading.
- **Exercise**: Write a program with methods for basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### 5. Arrays and Basic Data Structures
- **Topics**: Arrays, array manipulation, enhanced for loops.
- **Exercise**: Write a program to find the largest and smallest elements in an array of numbers.

## Intermediate Level

### 1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics
- **Topics**: Classes, objects, constructors, `this` keyword, `static` keyword.
- **Exercise**: Create a `Car` class with attributes like make, model, and speed. Add methods to accelerate and brake.

### 2. Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism
- **Topics**: Access modifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`), getters/setters, inheritance, `super` keyword, method overriding, polymorphism.
- **Exercise**: Create a class hierarchy with a superclass `Employee` and subclasses `Manager` and `Developer`. Use inheritance and demonstrate polymorphism by overriding a `calculateSalary` method.

### 3. Interfaces and Abstract Classes
- **Topics**: Interfaces, abstract classes, interface implementation, multiple inheritance through interfaces.
- **Exercise**: Create an interface `Flyable` with a method `fly()`. Implement this interface in classes `Bird` and `Airplane`.

### 4. Exception Handling
- **Topics**: Try-catch blocks, `throw`, `throws`, custom exceptions.
- **Exercise**: Write a program that divides two numbers and catches possible exceptions (e.g., divide by zero).

### 5. Java Collections Framework
- **Topics**: Lists (`ArrayList`, `LinkedList`), Sets (`HashSet`, `TreeSet`), Maps (`HashMap`, `TreeMap`), Iterators, basic operations.
- **Exercise**: Write a program that counts the frequency of words in a sentence using a `HashMap`.

## Advanced Level

### 1. Generics
- **Topics**: Generics with classes, methods, bounded types.
- **Exercise**: Implement a generic `Pair` class that holds two objects of any type and write methods to retrieve and display them.

### 2. Java Streams and Lambda Expressions
- **Topics**: Stream API, lambda expressions, method references, functional interfaces.
- **Exercise**: Create a list of integers and use Java Streams to filter even numbers, sort them, and print each one using a lambda expression.

### 3. File I/O and Serialization
- **Topics**: Reading and writing files (`File`, `FileReader`, `BufferedReader`, `FileWriter`), serialization with `Serializable`.
- **Exercise**: Write a program that reads a text file and counts the occurrence of each word. Save the result to another file.

### 4. Concurrency and Multithreading
- **Topics**: Threads, `Runnable` interface, `Thread` class, synchronization, `ExecutorService`, concurrency utilities (`CountDownLatch`, `Semaphore`, `ReentrantLock`).
- **Exercise**: Write a program that starts multiple threads to calculate the sum of large sections of an array and combines the results.

### 5. Annotations and Reflection
- **Topics**: Built-in annotations (`@Override`, `@Deprecated`), custom annotations, reflection (`Class` class, accessing methods and fields).
- **Exercise**: Create a custom annotation `@Test` for methods. Write a program using reflection to find and invoke all methods annotated with `@Test`.

### 6. Networking with Java
- **Topics**: Sockets, `ServerSocket`, client-server communication.
- **Exercise**: Create a simple client-server application where the server responds with the current date and time when requested by the client.

### 7. Java 8+ Features
- **Topics**: Newer Java features, such as `Optional`, Stream API, `LocalDate` and `LocalTime`, `CompletableFuture`.
- **Exercise**: Write a program that uses `Optional` to handle the potential absence of values, such as retrieving a user by ID that may or may not exist.

## Expert Level

### 1. Design Patterns in Java
- **Topics**: Singleton, Factory, Observer, Builder, Adapter, Dependency Injection.
- **Exercise**: Implement a Singleton pattern for a database connection class, ensuring thread safety.

### 2. Memory Management and Garbage Collection
- **Topics**: JVM memory structure, garbage collection mechanisms, memory leaks.
- **Exercise**: Write a program that demonstrates how objects are garbage-collected when they are no longer referenced.

### 3. JDBC and Database Integration
- **Topics**: JDBC basics, connecting to databases, executing SQL statements, prepared statements, transaction management.
- **Exercise**: Connect to a relational database (e.g., MySQL) and perform CRUD operations with `PreparedStatement`.

### 4. Testing and Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- **Topics**: Unit testing with JUnit, mocking with Mockito, TDD principles.
- **Exercise**: Write unit tests for a `Calculator` class using JUnit and Mockito.

### 5. Spring Framework Basics
- **Topics**: Dependency Injection, Spring Core, Spring Boot for rapid application development.
- **Exercise**: Create a RESTful API using Spring Boot that allows users to perform CRUD operations on a `Product` entity.

### 6. Microservices and Distributed Systems
- **Topics**: Basics of microservices, RESTful services, service discovery, load balancing, resilience patterns (like circuit breaker).
- **Exercise**: Create a simple microservice in Spring Boot and connect it to another service using REST.

### 7. Advanced Concurrency with Fork/Join Framework and Parallel Streams
- **Topics**: Fork/Join framework, parallel processing with streams, handling parallel tasks.
- **Exercise**: Use the Fork/Join framework to process a large dataset in parallel.
